#  Collector

> **Turn forgotten dust into real value.**

Dust collector is a DeFi tool built on the Base network that collects and aggregates tiny token balances (a.k.a. “dust”) from users' wallets. With a single click, users can reclaim these forgotten assets and either **withdraw** them or **donate** them to a cause.

> ✅ Designed for simplicity — even your grandma can use it.

## 🔥 Features

- **Dust Collection:**  
  Connect your wallet, select tiny token balances, and send them to the aggregator.

- **Aggregation & Swapping:**  
  All tokens are automatically prepared for conversion into a single stable token (e.g., ETH on Base).

- **Withdraw or Donate:**  
  After dust is collected and swapped, users can choose to:
  - **Withdraw** their recovered value.
  - **Donate** to a selected address (e.g., a public goods treasury , charity).

- **Coming Soon – Staking:**  
  Instead of withdrawing, soon users will be able to **stake** their recovered dust — turning trash into passive yield.

## 💡 Why This Matters

Millions of wallets hold unusable token fragments — assets too small to trade or withdraw due to gas costs.  
Dust Aggregator brings that value back into circulation — all on a fast, cheap, and user-friendly chain: **Base**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet**
2. **Select Dust Tokens**
3. **Deposit to Aggregator**
4. **Choose: Withdraw or Donate**
5. *(Optional: Stake in the future)*

All contracts and interactions are fully non-custodial and on-chain.
